# Unsupervised Best Buy Review Analysis

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook for analyzing customer reviews from Best Buy using unsupervised learning techniques. The project aims to identify patterns, clusters, and insights from textual review data.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates:
- Preprocessing and cleaning textual review data.
- Applying unsupervised machine learning methods to extract insights.
- Visualizing patterns and clusters within the data.

## Prerequisites

To run this notebook, ensure the following libraries are installed:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `nltk`
- `wordcloud`
- Any other libraries specified in the notebook.

Install missing packages using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk wordcloud
```

## Sections in the Notebook

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Load and clean the textual review data.
- Perform tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming/lemmatization.

### 2. Feature Extraction
- Convert textual data into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF or Bag of Words.

### 3. Unsupervised Learning
- Apply clustering algorithms such as K-Means or hierarchical clustering.
- Explore topic modeling using methods like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA).

### 4. Data Visualization
- Generate visualizations like word clouds and cluster distributions to interpret results.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yssh03/Unsupervised-Best-Buy-Review-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the notebook in Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Unsupervised_Best_Buy_Review_Analysis.ipynb
   ```
3. Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Results
The analysis includes:
- Identification of common topics or themes in customer reviews.
- Clustering of reviews into meaningful groups.
- Insights that can inform business strategies and customer engagement.
